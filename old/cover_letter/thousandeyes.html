Hey ThousandEyes !  My name is Pia and I am currently in my senior year at Waterloo’s Finance program. I'm reaching out to you to express my interest in your Web Apps Software Engineer intern position.

Wait, what. Finance student? Allow me to explain. It started roughly a year ago when a friend of mine showed me the portfolio website he had developed for himself. Having never even thought of what goes into making a website, I was struck with complete awe and quickly found myself playing around with web technologies.

Tutorials turned into Codepen experiments and eventually grew into full projects. It’s hard to translate my feelings into words but I pretty much fell in love with my new hobby. My goal is to work on innovative projects  and at with a team that values and  challenges their interns. From your job description, it looks like you do just that.  

I'm experienced with D3, Angular and Sass and have worked with the other half of your web stack at one point or another (except Spring). Please check out my projects at https://misspia.github.io and don't hesitate to contact me at pyyleung@uwaterloo.ca if you're as excited as I am to work together :) 

Hope to hear from you soon! Pia


Unique?
I don't just say, I DO. I told myself that accounting isn't for me so I cranked open CS textbooks and sat for hours in front of Sublime (still am lol)
