		Hello CareGuide!
	</div>
	<div class="col space-around section body">
		<p>
			My name is Pia and I am currently in my senior year at Waterloo’s Finance program. I am writing to you to express my interest in your Software Engineering Intern posting on WaterlooWorks. I am available for a 4 month work term.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hold up. Finance student? Allow me to explain. It started roughly a year ago when a friend of mine showed me the portfolio website he had developed for himself. Having never even thought of what goes into making a website, I was struck with complete awe and quickly found myself playing around with web technologies.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tutorials turned into Codepen experiments and eventually grew into full projects. It’s hard to translate my feelings into words but I pretty much fell in love with my new hobby. I was more than overjoyed when I landed my software internship with Manulife’s innovation lab. During my time as a full stack developer,  I worked on several web based projects  and attracted the attention of the Artificial Intelligence team sitting next to us. They were especially pleased with my front end and data visualization skills and I ended up creating client side applications for their APIs.
		</p>
		<p>
			My goal is to work on awesome projects and with a team that will seriously challenge me. From your job description, it looks like that’s exactly what you offer. I take my work seriously but I also remember to have lots of fun with it :) Check out my favourite projects at
			<a href="https://misspia.github.io/" class="link semi-bold">misspia.github.io</a>. Dont hesitate to contact me at <span class="link semi-bold">pyyleung@uwaterloo.ca</span> if you're as excited as I am to work together.
