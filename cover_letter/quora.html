Hey Quora !  My name is Pia and I am currently in my senior year at uWaterloo’s Finance program. I'm reaching out to you to express my interest in your UI Software Engineer intern position.

Wait, what. Finance student? Allow me to explain. It started roughly a year ago when a friend of mine showed me the portfolio website he had developed for himself. Having never even thought of what goes into making a website, I was struck with complete awe and quickly found myself playing around with web technologies.

Many tutorials, textbooks (recommended by users in Quora threads actually!) and Codepen experiments later, I found myself tackling full on projects. It’s hard to translate my feelings into words but I pretty much fell in love with my new hobby. My goal is to push my skills to the limits and work at a firm will constantly challenge me to strive for perfection. And I know Quora will do just that.

Please check out my projects at misspia.github.io and don't hesitate to contact me at pyyleung@uwaterloo.ca if you're as excited as I am to work together :) 

Hope to hear from you soon! Pia
