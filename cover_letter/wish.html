Hey Wish!  My name is Pia and I am currently in my senior year at Waterloo’s Finance program. 

Wait, what. Finance student? Allow me to explain. It started roughly a year ago when a friend of mine showed me the portfolio website he had developed for himself. Having never even thought of what goes into making a website, I was struck with complete awe and quickly found myself playing around with web technologies.

Tutorials turned into Codepen experiments and eventually grew into full projects. It’s hard to translate my feelings into words but I pretty much fell in love with my new hobby. Wish is a fast growing start up that provides every Wish-ee the oppertunity to make a huge contribution. My dream internship is one where I will be surrounded by passionate people who constantly challenge me to push beyond my limits- and I know the Wish team will do exactly that.
