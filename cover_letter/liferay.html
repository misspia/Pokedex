Hey Liferay !  My name is Pia and I am currently in my senior year at Waterloo’s Finance program. I'm writing to you to express my interest in your Software Engineer Intern position with a preference in the front end role.

Wait, what. Finance student? Allow me to explain. It started roughly a year ago when a friend of mine showed me the portfolio website he had developed for himself. Having never even thought of what goes into making a website, I was struck with complete awe and quickly found myself playing around with web technologies.

Tutorials turned into Codepen experiments and eventually grew into full projects. It’s hard to translate my feelings into words but I pretty much fell in love with my new hobby. My goal is to work on projects that I'd happily lose sleep to finish and at a company that takes serious pride in mentoring and pushing their interns to the limit. From your job description, it looks like you do just that.  

Please check out my projects at the links I provided and don't hesitate to contact me at pyyleung@uwaterloo.ca if you're as excited as I am to work together :) 

Hope to hear from you soon! Pia
